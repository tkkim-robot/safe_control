# safe_control

`safe_control` is a Python library that provides a unified codebase for safety-critical controllers in robotic navigation. It implements various control barrier function (CBF) based controllers and other types of safety-critical controllers.

## Features

- Implementation of various positional safety-critical controllers, including [`CBF-QP`](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8796030) and [`MPC-CBF`](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9483029)
- Implementation of safety-critical attitude controller using [`gatekeeper`](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10341790)
- Support for different robot dynamics models (e.g., unicycle, double integrator)
- Support sensing and mapping simulation for RGB-D type camera sensors (limited FOV)
- Support both single and multi agents navigation
- Interactive plotting and visualization

## Installation

To install `safe_control`, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tkkim-robot/safe_control.git
   cd safe_control
   ```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

3. Install the package and its dependencie:
   ```bash
   python -m pip install -e .
   ```
   Or, install packages manually (see [`setup.py`](https://github.com/tkkim-robot/safe_control/blob/main/setup.py)).


## Getting Started

Familiarize with APIs and examples with the scripts in [`tracking.py`](https://github.com/tkkim-robot/safe_control/blob/main/tracking.py)

### Basic Example
You can run our test example by:

```bash
python tracking.py
```

Alternatively, you can import `LocalTrackingController` from [`tracking.py`](https://github.com/tkkim-robot/safe_control/blob/main/tracking.py).

```python
from safe_control.tracking import LocalTrackingController
controller = LocalTrackingController(x_init, robot_spec,
                                control_type=control_type,
                                dt=dt,
                                show_animation=True,
                                save_animation=False,
                                ax=ax, fig=fig,
                                env=env_handler)

# assuming you have set the workspace (environment) in utils/env.py
controller.set_waypoints(waypoints)
_ _= controller.run_all_steps(tf=100)
```

You can also design your own navigation logic using the controller. `contorl_step()` function simulates one time step.

```python
# self refers to the LocalTrackingController class.
for _ in range(int(tf / self.dt)):
    ret = self.control_step()
    self.draw_plot()
    if ret == -1:  # all waypoints reached
        break
self.export_video()
```

The sample results from the basic example:

The green points are the given waypoints, and the blue area is the accumulated sensing footprints.

The gray circles are the obstacles that are known a priori.

### Detect/Avoid Unknown Obstacles
You can also simulate online detection of unknown obstacles and avoidance of obstacles that are detected on-the-fly using safety-critical constratins.
The configuration of the obstacles is (x, y, radius).

```python
unknown_obs = np.array([[2, 2, 0.2], [3.0, 3.0, 0.3]])
controller.set_unknown_obs(unknown_obs)

# then, run simulation
```

The unknown obstacles are visualized in orange.

### Multi-Robot Example

You can simulate heterogeneous, multiple robots navigating in the same environment. 

```python
robot_spec = {
    'model': 'Unicycle2D',
    'robot_id': 0
    }
controller_0 = LocalTrackingController(x_init, robot_spec)

robot_spec = {
    'model': 'DynamicUnicycle2D',
    'robot_id': 1,
    'a_max': 1.5,
    'fov_angle': 90.0,
    'cam_range': 5.0,
    'radius': 0.25
}
controller_1 = LocalTrackingController(x_init, robot_spec)

# then, run simulation
```

First determine the specification of each robot (with different `id`), then run the simulation.

## Module Breakdown

### Dynamics

Supported robot dynamics can be found in the [`robots/`](https://github.com/tkkim-robot/safe_control/tree/main/robots) directory:

- `single_integrator2D`
- `double_integrator2D`
- `single_integrator2D with camera angle`: allow to rotate
- `double_integrator2D with camera angle`
- `unicycle2D`
- `dynamic_unicycle2D`: A unicycle model that uses velocity as state and acceleration as input.
- `kinematic_bicycle2D`: need to use [`C3BF`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07043) for valid CBF. See [`robots/kinematic_bicycle2D_c3bf.py](https://github.com/tkkim-robot/safe_control/blob/main/robots/kinematic_bicycle2D_c3bf.py) for more details.
- `quad2d`: x - forward, z - vertical
- `quad3d`: (* dynamics are implemented, work in progress for a valid CBF)
- `vtol2d`: x - forward, z - vertical

### Positional Control Algorithms

Supported positional controllers can be found in the [`position_control/`](https://github.com/tkkim-robot/safe_control/tree/main/position_control) directory:

- `cbf_qp`: A simple CBF-QP controller for collision avoidance (ref: [[1]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8796030))
- `mpc_cbf`: An MPC controller using discrete-time CBF (ref: [[2]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9483029))
- `optimal_decay_cbf_qp`: A modified CBF-QP for point-wise feasibility guarantee (ref: [[3]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9482626))
- `optimal_decay_mpc_cbf`: The same technique applied to MPC-CBF (ref: [[4]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9683174))

To use a specific control algorithm, specify it when initializing the `LocalTrackingController`:

```python
controller = LocalTrackingController(..., control_type='cbf_qp', ...)
```

### Attitude Control Algorithms

Supported attitude controllers can be found in the [`attitude_control/`](https://github.com/tkkim-robot/safe_control/tree/main/attitude_control) directory:

- `gatekeeper`: A safety filter between pre-defined nominal and backup controller, designed to guarantee safety for infinite time (ref: [[5]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10665919))
- `velocity tracking yaw`
- `visibility promoting yaw`: A simple visibility promoting attitude controller based on the accumulated map

### Customizing Environments

You can modify the environment in [`utils/env.py`](https://github.com/tkkim-robot/safe_control/blob/main/utils/env.py).

### Visualization
The online visualization is performed using [`matplotlib.pyplot.ion`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.ion.html).

It allows you to interatively scroll, resize, change view, etc. during simulation.

You can visualize and save animation by setting the arguments:
```python
controller = LocalTrackingController(..., show_animation=True, save_animation=True)
```
